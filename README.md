This is my repository for the SoC project on device drivers - "SoC Driver's License Learning to Talk to Hardware". Week-wise assignments have been solved in the respective folders.

## STATUS:  
### Week 0 <br>
Built kernel from scratch<br>
### Week 1 <br>
Read about processes, traps, context switching and virtual address spaces<br>
Looked at various ways to analyse processes
Wrote my first LKM (Loadable Kernel Module) - a "hello world" one, and another one to extract information about processes running on the system <br>
### Week 2 <br>
Learned what system calls are, in particular fork, wait, exec, kill and signal. Read about signals and how different processes can communicate with each other. Read about user mode and kernel mode for privelege separation. Wrote programs with individual system calls and then built a rudimentary shell by combining them. <br>
#### Week 3 <br>
Reading now, got to know about virtual memory in detail - address translation, paging, caching using TLB. <br>
